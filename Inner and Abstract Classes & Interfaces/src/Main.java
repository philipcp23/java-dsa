        /*
        Create a simple interface that allows an object to be saved to some sort of storage medium.
        The exact type of medium is not known to the interface nor to the classes that implement it.
        The interface will just specify 2 methods, one to return an ArrayList of values to be saved
        and the other to populate the object's fields from an ArrayList.

        Create some sample classes that implement your saveable interface
        Override the toString() for each of your classes so that they can be easily printed to
        enable the program to be tested easier.

        In Main, write a method that takes an object that implements the interface as a parameter and "saves" the values.
        We haven't covered IO yet, so your method should just print the values to the screen.
        Also in Main, write a method that restores the values to a saveable object.
        Simulate getting values from a file - this allows you to type as many values as your class requires,
        and returns an ArrayList.
